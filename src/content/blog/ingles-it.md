## üîç Code Reviews y Feedback

### 1. Giving Constructive Feedback

#### **Positive Feedback Patterns**
```

üëç Appreciation:
"Great job implementing this feature!"
"I really like how you handled the error cases here"
"This is a clean and efficient solution"
"Nice use of design patterns"
"The code is well-documented and easy to follow"
"Good thinking on the edge case handling"

üí° Constructive Suggestions:
"This looks good overall. One small suggestion..."
"Consider extracting this logic into a separate function"
"We might want to add some error handling here"
"Have you thought about the performance implications?"
"This could be simplified by using..."
"What do you think about renaming this variable to be more descriptive?"

```

#### **Technical Feedback**
```

üîß Code Quality:
"This function is getting a bit long. Consider breaking it down"
"The variable name 'data' is too generic. How about 'userProfile'?"
"Missing error handling for the API call"
"Consider using constants instead of magic numbers"
"This could benefit from some unit tests"
"The cyclomatic complexity is high here"

üöÄ Performance:
"This query might be slow with large datasets"
"Consider using pagination for this endpoint"
"We should cache this expensive operation"
"This algorithm has O(n¬≤) complexity. Can we optimize it?"
"Memory usage could be improved by..."

```

### 2. Receiving Feedback

#### **Responding to Code Reviews**
```

‚úÖ Accepting Feedback:
"Good point! I'll refactor that function"
"Thanks for catching that edge case"
"You're absolutely right about the performance issue"
"I hadn't considered that scenario. Let me fix it"
"That's a much cleaner approach. I'll implement it"

‚ùì Asking for Clarification:
"Could you elaborate on what you mean by 'more descriptive'?"
"I'm not sure I understand the performance concern. Could you explain?"
"What would you suggest as an alternative approach?"
"Can you point me to the style guide for this?"
"Is there a specific pattern you'd recommend here?"

ü§ù Collaborative Discussion:
"I see your point. Another option would be..."
"Both approaches have merit. What do you think about...?"
"I chose this method because of... but I'm open to alternatives"
"That's interesting. I hadn't considered that trade-off"
"Let's discuss this in person to find the best solution"

```

### 3. Common Code Review Scenarios

#### **Security Concerns**
```

üîí Security Feedback:
"This endpoint should require authentication"
"We need to sanitize user input here to prevent XSS"
"This query is vulnerable to SQL injection"
"Sensitive data should be encrypted before storing"
"Consider implementing rate limiting for this API"
"The JWT token should have an expiration time"

Example Response:
"You're absolutely right about the SQL injection risk. I'll switch to parameterized queries."

```

#### **Architecture Discussions**
```

üèóÔ∏è Architecture Feedback:
"This creates a tight coupling between components"
"Consider using dependency injection here"
"This violates the single responsibility principle"
"We should follow the established patterns in this codebase"
"This logic belongs in the service layer, not the controller"

Example Response:
"I see the coupling issue. Let me refactor this to use an interface instead."

## üÜò Frases de Supervivencia IT

### 1. Situaciones de Crisis

#### **System Down Scenarios**
```

üö® Emergency Communication:
"We have a critical issue in production"
"The database server is not responding"
"We're experiencing a complete service outage"
"All API endpoints are returning 500 errors"
"We need to implement emergency measures immediately"

üîß Immediate Actions:
"I'm investigating the root cause"
"Rolling back to the previous deployment"

"The issue has been identified and we're working on a fix"
"ETA for resolution is approximately 30 minutes"
"Services are partially restored"
"We're monitoring the situation closely"
"Full service has been restored"

```

#### **Deadline Pressure**
```

‚è∞ Time Management:
"We're running behind schedule"
"The deadline is pretty tight"
"We need to prioritize the critical features"
"This is a nice-to-have, not a must-have"
"We might need to push back the release date"

üéØ Negotiating Scope:
"Given the time constraints, I suggest we..."
"We can deliver the core functionality by the deadline"
"The additional features will need to be in a future release"
"What's the minimum viable product for this deadline?"
"Can we get an extension for the complex features?"

```

### 2. When You Don't Understand

#### **Asking for Help Professionally**
```

‚ùì Seeking Clarification:
"I'm not quite following the logic here"
"Could you walk me through this process again?"
"I'm having trouble understanding the requirements"
"This is outside my area of expertise"
"I need some guidance on the best approach"

ü§ù Collaborative Problem-Solving:
"Let's pair program on this challenging part"
"Could we have a quick whiteboard session?"
"I'd appreciate a second opinion on this"
"Can someone review my approach before I proceed?"
"Let's break this down together"

```

#### **Learning New Technologies**
```

üìö Admitting Knowledge Gaps:
"I'm new to this framework"
"I haven't worked with this technology before"
"I'm still learning the best practices for..."
"This is my first time implementing..."
"I could use some mentoring on this"

üí° Showing Initiative:
"I've been reading the documentation"
"I found some tutorials on this topic"
"I'm planning to take a course on..."
"I've set up a learning environment to practice"
"Can you recommend any good resources?"

```

### 3. Diplomatic Disagreement

#### **Technical Disagreements**
```

ü§î Expressing Different Opinions:
"I see your point, but I have some concerns about..."
"That's an interesting approach. Have you considered...?"
"I'm not convinced this is the best solution because..."
"While that would work, I think we might run into issues with..."
"I understand the reasoning, but my experience suggests..."

üíº Professional Pushback:
"I respectfully disagree with this approach"
"The data doesn't support that conclusion"
"Based on the requirements, I think we should..."
"I'm concerned about the long-term maintainability"

## üèÜ Advanced Tips for IT Professionals

### 1. Industry-Specific Nuances
```

üéØ Context Matters:

- "Deploy" vs "Release" - Deploy is technical, Release is business
- "Bug" vs "Issue" - Bug is confirmed, Issue is reported
- "Framework" vs "Library" - Framework controls, Library is used
- "API" vs "Endpoint" - API is the interface, Endpoint is specific URL

```

### 2. Cultural Communication
```

üåç International Teams:

- Be explicit, avoid cultural idioms
- Use simple present for facts: "The API returns JSON"
- Confirm understanding: "Does that make sense?"
- Allow processing time for non-native speakers

```

### 3. Remote Work Communication
```

üíª Virtual Communication:

- Over-communicate in async environments
- Use clear subject lines in emails
- Record important decisions
- Follow up on action items
